	# For some reason, trim layers don't play nice with custom armor models (and I have given up trying to fix it now). You can choose what to do.
	# NORMAL - Will attempt to render anyway. Usually trims will be invisible but sometimes yields wierd results (such as "mystery belts" for some boots).
	# TINTED - Will tint armors the associated trim color.
	# HIDDEN - Will hide trims on custom armor models entirely. Default option; anything not specified will default to this. Currently not working for some reason, causing it to behave like TINTED.
